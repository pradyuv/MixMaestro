# MixMaestro
The Mix Maestro is a tool aimed to help music producers and enthusiasts by automatically adjusting mixing parameters such as levels, equalization (EQ), and effects. My project attempts to leverage machine learning and real-time audio processing to provide intelligent mixing recommendations and adjustments. Passion project.

# Overview
MixMaestro extracts a comprehensive set of audio features from tracks to aid producers/enthusiasts (and potentially) mix engineers in making informed decisions while leaving room for personal mixing choices. The features extracted provide detailed insights into various aspects of the audio signal, such as volume, frequency content, pitch, rhythm, and more.
