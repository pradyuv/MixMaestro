# MixMaestro
The Mix Maestro is a tool aimed to help music producers and enthusiasts by automatically adjusting mixing parameters such as levels, equalization (EQ), and effects. My project attempts to leverage machine learning and real-time audio processing to provide intelligent mixing recommendations and adjustments. Passion project.

# Overview
MixMaestro extracts a comprehensive set of audio features from tracks to aid producers/enthusiasts (and potentially) mix engineers in making informed decisions while leaving room for personal mixing choices. The features extracted provide detailed insights into various aspects of the audio signal, such as volume, frequency content, pitch, rhythm, and more.



# extract_features.py

  ## Purpose

  The extract_features.py script is designed to extract a wide range of audio features from an audio file. These features provide essential information about the audio signal's characteristics, which can be used for intelligent/learned mixing and audio analysis.  

  ## How It Works

  The script utilizes the [librosa library] (https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) to load audio files and extract various features. It processes multiple audio files in a directory, extracts the features, and saves them for further analysis or use in machine learning models.

  ## Key Components

    1. **Importing Libraries**:
      ```
      python
      import librosa  # Import the librosa library for audio processing
      import numpy as np  # Import NumPy for numerical operations
      import os  # Import the os library for file and directory operations
      import joblib  # Import the joblib library for saving and loading data
      ```
